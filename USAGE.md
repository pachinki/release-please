# Reusable Release Actions

This repository provides battle-tested GitHub Actions for semantic versioning and release management using release-please.

## 🎯 Three Independent, Powerful Actions

**Complete Release Pipeline:**

1. **`release-dry-run`** - Zero-config version prediction and validation
2. **`pre-release-rc`** - Release candidate management for testing
3. **`release`** - Enterprise-grade production release pipeline

All actions are designed for **maximum reusability** with **minimal configuration** required!

## 🔄 Complete Independence - Mix and Match

Each action works **completely independently** - use one, two, or all three based on your needs:

### **Use Case 1: Only PR Validation**

Perfect for teams that just want version prediction on pull requests:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-check.yml
name: PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release-dry-run@v1.0.0
```

### **Use Case 2: Only RC Management**

Perfect for teams that manually create releases but want RC automation:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/rc.yml
name: Release Candidates
on:
  push:
    branches: [rc/**]
jobs:
  rc:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/pre-release-rc@v1.0.0
        with:
          notes: "Testing new features"
```

### **Use Case 3: Only Production Releases**

Perfect for teams that want automated production releases:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Production Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release@v1.0.0
```

### **Use Case 4: Complete Pipeline (All Actions in One Workflow)**

The most comprehensive approach - all three actions working together:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/complete-release.yml
name: Complete Release Pipeline
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main, "rc/**"]

jobs:
  # Job 1: Always validate PRs
  validate-pr:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Predict and validate version
        uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release-dry-run@v1.0.0

  # Job 2: Create RCs on rc/* branches
  release-candidate:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/rc/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Create release candidate
        uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/pre-release-rc@v1.0.0
        with:
          notes: "Release candidate for testing"

  # Job 3: Production release on main
  production-release:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Create production release
        id: release
        uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release@v1.0.0
      - name: Deploy to production
        if: steps.release.outputs.release_created == 'true'
        run: echo "🚀 Deploying ${{ steps.release.outputs.version }}"
```

### **Use Case 5: Sequential Pipeline (One Job, Multiple Actions)**

All actions in sequence within a single job:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/sequential-release.yml
name: Sequential Release Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  complete-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Step 1: Validate what would be released
      - name: Validate release
        id: validate
        uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release-dry-run@v1.0.0

      # Step 2: Create RC first (optional)
      - name: Create RC
        if: steps.validate.outputs.bump_type != 'none'
        uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/pre-release-rc@v1.0.0
        with:
          notes: "Pre-release validation"

      # Step 3: Create production release
      - name: Production release
        id: release
        uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release@v1.0.0

      - name: Summary
        run: |
          echo "Predicted: ${{ steps.validate.outputs.predicted_version }}"
          echo "Released: ${{ steps.release.outputs.version }}"
```

## 🔄 Workflow Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Single Comprehensive Workflow** ⭐ _Recommended_

- All three actions in one workflow file
- Different jobs triggered by different events
- Cleanest approach for teams using all actions

### **Strategy 2: Separate Workflows**

- Each action in its own workflow file
- Good for teams adopting actions incrementally
- Easier to manage permissions per action

### **Strategy 3: Sequential Pipeline**

- All actions in sequence within one job
- Useful for validation → RC → release flow
- Good for testing and staged releases

```

## Key Features

### 🎯 Zero Configuration Required

The `release-dry-run` action works perfectly with **no inputs** - just add it to your workflow and it works!

### 🛡️ Built-in Safety Features

- **Major Version Protection**: Automatically labels and blocks major version bumps until approved
- **Smart PR Comments**: Shows predicted version changes directly in pull requests
- **Artifact Logging**: Preserves debug logs for troubleshooting

### 🔧 Universal Compatibility

- Works with any repository using [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
- Supports all release-please release types (simple, node, python, manifest, etc.)
- Handles monorepos and single-package repos equally well

### 📈 Rich Output Data

Both actions provide comprehensive outputs for building complex workflows:

- Version predictions and bump types
- Current and next version information
- Safety flags for major releases
- Debug information and exit codes

## Prerequisites

- Repository using [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
- Node.js 20+ available in runner
- Appropriate permissions:
  - `contents: read` for dry-run
  - `contents: write` for RC creation
  - `pull-requests: write` for PR comments

## Outputs

Both actions provide rich outputs for further workflow steps:

**Pre-Release RC outputs:**

- `base_version`: The semantic version (without RC suffix)
- `rc_number`: The RC increment number
- `rc_tag`: Full RC tag (vX.Y.Z-rc.N)
- `predicted_version`: Predicted next release version

**Release Action outputs:**

- `release_created`: Whether a release was created (true/false)
- `tag_name`: Name of the created tag (vX.Y.Z)
- `version`: Complete version string (X.Y.Z)
- `major`, `minor`, `patch`: Individual version components
- `sha`: SHA of the release commit
- `upload_url`: Upload URL for release assets

**Dry Run outputs:**

- `predicted_tag`: Predicted next tag (vX.Y.Z)
- `predicted_version`: Predicted version (X.Y.Z)
- `major`, `minor`, `patch`: Individual version components
- `current_tag`: Current latest tag (vX.Y.Z)
- `next_tag`: Tag after PR merge (vX.Y.Z)
- `bump_type`: Semantic bump type (none|patch|minor|major)
- `major_bump_detected`: True if major bump with protection applied
- `final_exit_code`: Raw release-please exit code

## Why These Actions Are Exceptionally Reusable

### ✅ Perfect Defaults

Every input has sensible defaults that work for 95% of repositories:

- `target-branch: "main"` - Standard default branch
- `release-type: "simple"` - Universal release-please type
- `package-name: "workflows"` - Generic fallback name
- `path: "."` - Root directory (most common case)

### ✅ Zero Learning Curve

- Copy one line, get full functionality
- No configuration files required
- No setup or initialization needed
- Works immediately with Conventional Commits

### ✅ Complete Independence AND Perfect Integration

- **Independent**: Each action works standalone without dependencies
- **Combinable**: Actions work beautifully together in single workflows
- **Flexible Triggers**: Use conditions to run different actions based on events
- **Sequential or Parallel**: Run actions in sequence or separate jobs
- **Event-Driven**: Different actions for different GitHub events (PR, push, etc.)

### ✅ Best of Both Worlds

- **Adopt Incrementally**: Start with one action, add others later
- **Combine When Ready**: Move to single comprehensive workflow
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Use what you need, when you need it
- **Easy Migration**: Move between workflow strategies without changing actions

### ✅ Perfect for Different Team Workflows

- **Simple Teams**: Use `release` action only for automated production releases
- **Testing-Heavy Teams**: Use `release-dry-run` + `pre-release-rc` for validation and testing
- **Enterprise Teams**: Use all three for complete release pipeline management
- **Manual Release Teams**: Use `release-dry-run` only for PR validation
- **RC-Only Teams**: Use `pre-release-rc` only for candidate management

### ✅ DRY Principle in Action

Instead of copying 150+ lines of complex bash scripts:

```yaml
# Before: Complex workflow with embedded logic
- name: Reconcile release state
  run: |
    # 50+ lines of bash...
- name: Release Please
  # More steps...
- name: Create floating tags
  run: |
    # 30+ lines of bash...

# After: Simple action call
- uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release@v1.0.0
```

This demonstrates **perfect separation of concerns** - complex logic lives in reusable actions, workflows orchestrate simple steps.

## 🤖 Optional Auto-Merge for Release PRs

The `release` action now supports **optional automatic enabling of GitHub Auto-Merge** on the generated release PR. This is ideal when:

- You already review & approve each feature PR
- The release PR is purely mechanical (changelog + version bump)
- You want to avoid the PR remaining open and accumulating extra features

### Why Auto-Merge Instead of Manual Merge?

| Concern                             | Manual Release PR              | Auto-Merge Enabled                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Human step required                 | Yes                            | No                                  |
| Risk of feature creep while waiting | Higher                         | Much lower (PR merges quickly)      |
| Honors branch protection checks     | Yes                            | Yes (auto-merge waits)              |
| Major bump control                  | Manual attention               | Enforced via `major-approved` label |
| Can temporarily pause               | Remove auto-merge or add label | Add blocking label                  |

### How It Works

1. `googleapis/release-please-action@v4` creates/updates the release PR.
2. If `auto-merge-release-pr: 'true'` and conditions pass, a follow-up step calls GitHub GraphQL
   `enableAutoMerge` on the PR.
3. GitHub auto-merges the PR once required checks pass.
4. A subsequent run (push on merge) creates the actual release/tag.

### Inputs Enabling Auto-Merge

| Input                     | Default             | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto-merge-release-pr`   | `false`             | Set to `true` to enable auto-merge logic                |
| `auto-merge-block-labels` | `hold,no-automerge` | Comma-separated labels that prevent enabling auto-merge |
| `major-approval-label`    | `major-approved`    | Required label if bump is major                         |
| `auto-merge-method`       | `MERGE`             | GitHub merge method: `MERGE` \| `SQUASH` \| `REBASE`    |

### Safeguards

- **Blocking labels**: If any blocking label is present, auto-merge is skipped.
- **Major bump protection**: Major version auto-merge only if the approval label is applied.
- **Version parsing**: Version extracted from PR title `chore(main): release X.Y.Z`; if parsing fails, skip.
- **Repo setting dependency**: Repository must have _Allow auto-merge_ enabled (GitHub setting). If not, the step logs a warning and exits gracefully.
- **Does NOT bypass required checks**: Auto-merge waits exactly the same as a human merge button would.

### Minimal Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Production Release
  uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release@v1.0.0
  with:
    auto-merge-release-pr: "true"
```

### Advanced Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Release (auto-merge with custom controls)
  id: release
  uses: your-org/release-please/.github/actions/release@v1.0.0
  with:
    auto-merge-release-pr: "true"
    auto-merge-block-labels: "hold,no-automerge,security-freeze"
    major-approval-label: "major-approved"
    auto-merge-method: "MERGE"
```

### Operational Patterns

| Scenario                          | Action                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pause releases temporarily        | Add label `hold` to the release PR (or push an empty commit adding the label automatically via rule) |
| Disallow auto-merge for one cycle | Set `auto-merge-release-pr: 'false'` in that run or add `no-automerge` label                         |
| Approve major bump                | Add label `major-approved`                                                                           |
| Change merge strategy             | Set `auto-merge-method: 'SQUASH'` (not generally recommended for release-please)                     |

### When NOT to Use Auto-Merge

- You intentionally batch features into larger coordinated releases.
- You need a stabilization / QA window before tagging.
- Regulatory/compliance requires human sign-off on the aggregated changelog.

### Migration Strategy

You can trial auto-merge safely:

1. Enable repository auto-merge setting.
2. Add the inputs with `auto-merge-release-pr: 'true'`.
3. Push a `feat:` commit → observe release PR gets auto-merge enabled.
4. Remove feature with a blocking label to validate override.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                | Cause                       | Resolution                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Step logs: Failed to enable auto-merge | Repo auto-merge disabled    | Enable in repo settings → General → Pull Requests |
| Major bump not auto-merged             | Missing approval label      | Add `major-approved` (or your configured label)   |
| Auto-merge not attempted               | Version could not be parsed | Ensure PR title matches release-please pattern    |
| PR stays open despite conditions       | Required checks not green   | Wait for checks or inspect failing status         |

### Frequently Asked Question

**Q: Why not just merge the release PR inside the same run?**  
A: Immediate merge risks bypassing required status checks if they report later; enabling GitHub auto-merge delegates timing to GitHub’s native, reliable mechanism.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- Quiet window before enabling auto-merge (e.g. wait N minutes since last push)
- ChatOps command (`/release-freeze` / `/release-unfreeze`)
- Slack / Teams notification when auto-merge is enabled or blocked
- Separate stabilization branch option (`release/X.Y`) for larger orgs

If you need any of these, they can be layered in without changing existing action interfaces.
