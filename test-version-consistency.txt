This file is created to test version consistency between dry-run and actual release.

The dry-run should now predict the same version that the actual release workflow will create, 
because both now use the same release-please CLI with identical configuration.

Expected behavior:
- Dry-run prediction should match actual release version
- No more discrepancy between predicted 4.5.0 and actual 5.0.0-rc.2
- Both workflows use release-please CLI with same config files

This change is a feature addition to test the consistency fix.
